# Privacy Policy

This __privacy policy__(_henceforth referred to as policy_) is established to inform the __end-user__ (_henceforth referred to as user_) as to:
  1. The nature of information pertaining to the user (if any at all) is read, processed, retained and/ or distributed.
  2. The identities of the entities (if any) said data has been shared with.
  3. The format in which said data is represented.
  4. The method in which said data has been secured from external inspection if required.

Privacy is taken __very seriously__ at TwoSixFourSix and the user should know:
  1. Absolutely __no information__ is collected from the user device __except those perhaps collected by Google via automatic Android telemetry (if any).__
  2. Great care is taken so as not to expose user information (sensitive or otherwise) to other entities.
  3. The application does not have the necessary internal	permissions (nor does it ever attempt) to connect to any Internet network.
  4. No data is retained by the application except <b>application theme preference</b>, and <b>a temporary cache file</b> - both of which can be removed by clearing the application data or uninstalling the application.

__Utmost diligence and considerable effort has been employed to ensure user data privacy and safety within the application - however, due
to the dynamic nature of modern computer systems, the developer is unable to guarantee complete user data security in case of extraction via root access, code exploit or hardware manipulation of device.__

__The developer retains full authority to subject this policy to change at any time, upon which users will be notified in a reasonable manner.__
